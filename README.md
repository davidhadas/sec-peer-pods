# Secure Peer Pods

This repo is used as a playground for securing connection for peer pods.

The repo allows a trusted environment to securly setup and control peer pods across an untrusted network.
All communication is initiated by the trusted environment such that the trused environment is not expected to open any ports and may reside behind a firewall.
The trusted environment offers all CoCo and Kubernetes services to control and serve peer pods.
